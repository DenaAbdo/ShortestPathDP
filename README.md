This project implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the shortest path between cities in a given network. The algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path by breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and solving them recursively.

### Features
- Calculate the shortest path between two selected cities.
- Efficient dynamic programming implementation.
- Display the path and distance in a user-friendly format.
